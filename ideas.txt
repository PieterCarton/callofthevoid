Entropic Battery: gain charge when broken (amount depends on tier) OR passive gain in void
			-Multiple tiers with different capacities
			-Early game power gen

Energy Direction Node:
	-easy transportation and retention of essence and energy, at the cost of some order

Some sort of material that is unnaffected by order and entropy (bedrock?)

Encased enery tubing:
	-transport to help avoid crossing of order/entropy

Chunk based energy/essence levels:
	-overworld: low level order energy
	-end: low level entropic energy
	-void: high level entropic energy

	-explosion upon cancelation of order and entropy

	-essence of disassembled items
	-item transport
	-gathering precious materials (background essence in void)
	-ore doubling (residue essence on smelting of ores)

Advancements:
-Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly
-Percussive Maintenance
-Yes, it needs to be red
